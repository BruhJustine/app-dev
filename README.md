## **Community**
> **Community** is a show that ran for 6 seasons, It garnered a cult following during its run time and completely blew up when it made its home in netflix around 2020. The show centered around a disbarred attorney name Jeff that used his words to manipulate people at first. The show then realized its potential when it focused on its main 7 crew cast, their differing opinions, attitudes, and personality blending with each other as they get into whacky community college highjinx. Throughout the show we see these characters grow and learn from their misadventures, and this is where I think Community truely shines. You just can't keep from watching the next episode to see how these characters have changed fundamentally from the episode before. The ending was also bittersweet, as we see the prophesized 6 seasons and a movie half fulfilled. Now fans, including myself, are eagerly awaiting the second half of that prophecy, the Community Movie.
